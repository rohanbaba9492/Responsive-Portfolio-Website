Responsive Portfolio Website

Description:

This project is a responsive personal portfolio website designed using HTML and CSS. It features a clean and modern layout, showcasing different sections such as header, footer, and portfolio items. The website is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across a variety of devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Media queries are utilized to adjust the layout for small devices (up to 768px wide). On smaller screens, the header and footer elements expand to fill the width of the device, while the portfolio/project images switch to a block layout, stacking vertically to fill the width of the screen. On larger screens, the images auto-wrap based on available space.
